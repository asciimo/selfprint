Here are some experiments in Processing with self-printing code. These aren't [quines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine) because they simply load their own .pde files at runtime.  I just wanted some code that would print its own source code out in interesting ways, and maybe pick one to etch onto my Macbook Air.

This is my first attempt.  Really just a proof-of-concept.  I definitely needs a lot of adjustment, but it's a start.
